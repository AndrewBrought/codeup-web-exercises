        (function(){ //Start of IIFE

      // var i = 1;
      // var pillow = "MyPillow";
      // var arr = [1,2,3];
      //
      // console.log(window);
      // BOM = browser object model
      //Window object is a global object in JS
        //Can access methods of the window object by conole.log-ging it

        // alert("hi, regiester for my site!");
        // window.alert("You really should register for my site...");

        // //when scoped inside of IIFE we are protecting our global variables from being accessible in the window object and therefore, being accessible by users.

        //WRITING JS CODE THAT CAN RUN AFTER A SET AMOUNT oF TIME, ONCE, OR MULTIPLE TIMES:

        // SET-INTERVAL METHOD -method allows code to be executed at a specified time interval. The specified code will continue executing at the given interval until the method clearInterval() is called.

        //Two parameters for the setInterval method
        //1: callback function or a defined function (handler)
        //2: The time.  The amount of time - in milliseconds - before the code runs again.

        //How to clear the interval ID:
        //1. - MUST set your setInterval method to a variable.  This is because the return of your setInterval method is an interval ID.
        //2. - Define the stop point. (clearInterval(intervalID)) - clear interval needs a to take in a parameter to point to what to stop
        var intervalID = setInterval(function(){
            var yesNo = confirm("Do you like websites chronicling the news surrounding the murder hornets?");
            if(yesNo) {
                alert("I know you just wanted to stop hearing about the murder hornets.  I don't blame you, honestly.");
                clearInterval(intervalID);
            }
        }, 5000);

        //Could be used on a banking app that wants to check on users looking at sensitive info after a certain amount of elapsed time
        //Real World Type of Application
        // var registerForMyWebzone = setInterval(function(){
        //     if(confirm("Hey, register for my website's mailing list!")){
        //         var userEmail = prompt("What is your email?");
        //         clearInterval(registerForMyWebzone);
        //     }
        // }, 5000);


        //When passing in a pre-defined function into another function - it is important to not pass in the function itself - to include () - but just the name of the function - which will pass the function definition...

        //==== ANOTHER EXAMPLE ====
// var x =1;
// var runThreeTimes = setInterval(function(){
//     alert("Fun times ahead this year!  Be sure to register with our newspaper for more information on GloboCo!");
//     if(x === 3){
//         clearInterval(runThreeTimes);
//     } else {
//         x++;
//     }
// }, 4500);

// ======  SetTimeout - similar to setInterval - but only meant to happen once: ======
        // Typically used as a reminder
        // setTimeout(function(){
        //     alert("CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WON!");
        // }, 9000);
        //
        // // ANOTHER EX:
        // function alertAdBlock() {
        //     alert("Hey, stop using AdBlocker!");
        // }
        //
        // setTimeout(alertAdBlock, 4500);
        //

        // window.location = "http://www.google.com"; // can Also be a relative pathway

            if(confirm("Did you make an error?")) {
                location.reload();
                // would only break out of this by saying 'cancel' or 'no'
            }
            //Can use this location.reload to reload the page to give the user the chance to experience that page again
            //if we want to force a reload from the serve, clear the cache, we can return true.
            //Marked for deprication happens when you call a method or function that's built in and it has a line through it...that means that there is a new alternative to this that will be coming soon.
            //location.reload()


        })(); // End of IIFE
